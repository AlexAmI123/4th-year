  By not providing "Findompl.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "ompl", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ompl" with any of
  the following names:

    omplConfig.cmake
    ompl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ompl" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ompl_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "ompl"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
